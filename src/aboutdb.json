      "bio" : "Maguy Le Coze, co-owner of Le Bernardin, was born in a small fishing village in Brittany, France, where her grandfather was a fisherman and her parents owned the Hotel de Rhuys, a small inn and restaurant. These early years instilled in Maguy an undying love of the sea and a continual appreciation of seafood.\n\nBy the time she was a teenager, Maguy was already working in the Hotel de Rhuys`` dining room, and her brother Gilbert was learning to cook in the kitchen. The siblings so impressed their father with their skills, that he opened La Biscorne, a summer disco, and let Maguy and Gilbert operate it. In the winter, the two traveled to the French Alps to work at popular clubs and restaurants at the ski resorts.\n\nIn 1972, while Maguy and Gilbert were still in their twenties, they moved to Paris and opened a small restaurant named Le Bernardin, after an order of monks devoted to good wine and food. Maguy and Gilbert borrowed recipes from family members in Brittany, and their parents would gather fresh ingredients, such as wild fennel, to ship to Paris by train. Le Bernardin became one of Paris`` hottest restaurants. In 1981, Le Bernardin moved to a larger location and a year later, received two Michelin stars.\n\nExpanding on their Parisian success, Gilbert and Maguy opened a second Le Bernardin in New York City in 1986. Just three months later, they received a four-star review from the New York Times, an unprecedented record. After selling the Parisian restaurant to focus on America, the two opened Brasserie Le Coze in Coconut Grove, Florida, which was named one of “America`s Best 25 Restaurants” by Esquire magazine. In 1994, they opened a second Brasserie Le Coze in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWith the untimely and tragic death of Gilbert in the summer of 1994, Maguy focused her energies on the New York operations. After selling the Coconut Grove restaurant and closing the restaurant in Atlanta, Maguy worked closely with Chef Eric Ripert to uphold Le Bernardin`s tradition of excellence and innovation. Following a significant and striking redesign by Bentel & Bentel in September 2011, Le Bernardin continues to maintain this tradition, simultaneously drawing a new generation of diners while staying true to the artistry and consistency that have made it such a success.\n\nIn September 2014, Maguy and Eric opened Aldo Sohm Wine Bar, named for their acclaimed wine director Aldo Sohm, just steps away from Le Bernardin. Set in a casual and convivial room, the wine bar offers a menu of simple, shareable plates meant to complement Aldo`s ever-changing, expertly curated wine list. That same month, Maguy and Eric expanded Le Bernardin`s private dining offerings with Le Bernardin Privé, a dynamic space above Aldo Sohm Wine Bar that can accommodate a range of events, including weddings, cocktail receptions and corporate meetings.\n\nMaguy received a 2013 James Beard Award for “Outstanding Restaurateur,” the first woman ever to be honored in this category. Under Maguy`s loving guidance, Le Bernardin continues to receive universal acclaim for its food and service, a testament to its timeless appeal."
